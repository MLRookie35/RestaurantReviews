# Missing values
First, we load the data and show the first couple lines here.
```{r}
restaurant_df <- read.csv(file = 'opentable.csv')

head(restaurant_df)
```
Then, we check the number of NA's in each column. 

```{r}
colSums(is.na(restaurant_df))
```
There are 10 NA's in each review columns. To find out where they are, we plot the missing patterns in data by rows with `mi` package.

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(mi)

x <- missing_data.frame(restaurant_df)

image(x)
```

From the plot above, we can see that all 10 missing values are in the same rows, so we decided to remove these rows by using `na.omit()` function. And we check again to make sure there are no NA's in the dataset. 

```{r}
restaurant_df <- na.omit(restaurant_df)
colSums(is.na(restaurant_df))
```



```{r}
write.csv(restaurant_df, './restaurant.csv')
```
