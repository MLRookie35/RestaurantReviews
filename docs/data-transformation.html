They materialized their dream with Gianpaolo&#39;s wife, Gabby Karan&#39;s sophisticated and visionary aesthetics when opening their first restaurant that year. Gabby created a concept of incredible interiors that are chic and intimate. She married art with culture to create her special approach to dining. Today, 10 years later, Tutto il Giorno is a proven success. Its secret sauce is its great staff and their passion for the restaurant.

## 17 A cool Mediterranean retreat from the city&#39;s chaos, with fabric-swathed ceilings and pristine white furnishings. Even on a hectic night, service is calm and competent, and the professional couples at most of the tables seem to be speaking in peaceful whispers. \nThe kitchen offers scintillating versions of hearty, refreshing Greek favorites. Souvlaki is charcoal-grilled and up scaled with filet mignon to produce an impressively tender, succulent result. Wine-marinated octopus legs are also charcoal-grilled, resulting in astounding flavor and not a hint of rubberness. Classics like garlicky skordalia, fava beans, sauteed chicken livers over lentils, and spanakopita are all best-of-breed versions, the latter prepared as a platter of bite-sized pies. A sizeable portion of moussaka, consisting of layers of juicy ground lamb and eggplant, tied together by a superlative b&lt;U+00A8&gt;&lt;U+00A6&gt;chamel. For dessert, the array of delicate pastries and the deeply creamy rice pudding are excellent without exception.

Guided by Chef Jeff McInnis and his partner, Chef Janine Booth, and focused on bringing honest, consciously sourced local ingredients, we strive to bring true Southern hospitality to New York City.While we are primarily a walk-in restaurant, we do take a very limited number of reservations. For parties of 6 or more, we require a prix fixe menu. A reservationist will contact you with details regarding the menu and pricing.  Thanks and we look forward to having you!

Jim and David, architect Richard Lewis and landscape architect Robin Key, preserved the Victorian/ Gothic elegance of the semi-circular building; it is authentic, natural, elegant and sexy.  It has been re-built to spectacular precision and the d&lt;U+00A8&gt;&lt;U+00A6&gt;cor is of a grand farmhouse one might find on the property of an Italian Villa or a historic Hudson River Valley mansion.
