<p>Weâ€™d like to join our datasets to see both the violations and the ratings. To accomplish that, we first convert all restaurants names to lower cases with <code>tolower()</code>, then strip symbols off on two datasets with <code>sub()</code> to create uniform syntax for names. After that, we used <code>sqldf</code> package to count the number of violations each restaurant has and join the two datasets together as our final dataset.</p>
<p>We can take a glance at the final dataset.</p>

<p>While the above final dataset contains information about restaurants which had violation records, in order to faciliate the interaction part of this project, we are going to create <code>cleaned_restaurants</code> and <code>cleaned_violations</code> datasets, so that we can 1.find each restaruantâ€™s violation total count (including 0) 2.boil down the large original violations file so the new file only contains restaurant weekâ€™s restaurantsâ€™ specific violation information.</p>
