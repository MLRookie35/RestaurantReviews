It has been re-built to spectacular precision and the d茅cor is of a grand farmhouse one might find on the property of an Italian Villa or a historic Hudson River Valley mansion. ## 3 ABC Kitchen with Jean-Georges: passionately committed to offering the freshest organic and local ingredients possible.ABC Kitchen presents a changing menu that is locally sourced and globally artistic in a fresh and articulate space. ## restaurant_main_type latitude longitude postal_code ## 1 Contemporary American 40.8011258 -73.9681923 10025 ## 2 American 40.7721869 -73.9777215 10023 ## 3 Contemporary American 40.7378971 -73.9894995 10003 Then, we check the number of NA’s in each column. ## name street_address google_map review_count phone website restaurant_type ## 0 1 3 3 4 6 5 ## average_review food_review service_review ambience_review value_review price_range star_1 ## 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ## star_2 star_3 star_4 star_5 description restaurant_main_type latitude ## 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 ## longitude postal_code ## 5 7 There are 5 NA’s in each review columns.
