# Data Transformation

We'd like to order the data by `average_review` to see the general ranking of the restaurants.

```{r}
data <- read.csv("restaurant.csv")
data <- data[order(data$average_review, decreasing = TRUE),]
unique(data$average_review)
```
After we ordered the restaurant data by `average_review`, we found out that the first rows do not have actual ratings, so we need to find out what these rows are and what to do with them.

```{r}
data[data$average_review == "Booked 0 times today",]
```
Since there are only two rows and these rows with invalid `average_review` columns also have invalid inputs in other columns, we decide to remove all these rows.
